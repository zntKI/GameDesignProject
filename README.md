# Platvolution

A project I chose to work on for my Game Design assignment, developed in Unity 2D.

## Overview
The game presents the evolution of 2D Platformers by observing three games â€“ Super Mario Bros, Hollow Knight and Celeste.
The Player starts as a beginner game designer, with a very basic set of abilities and as he progresses through it, he collects abilities that are characteristic for the currently observed game.
